Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)

It contains 4 different programs:
art_1    -- it is an original ART 1, only for binary input (0,1)

art_2A   -- it is ART 2A, real numbers input

	    
art_2A-C -- it is improved ART 2A

art_distance -- it is improved ART 2A_E, distance measures among instances 
	are based on various distances (e.g.:Euclidean,  Manhattan,...).
	The appropriate distance can be chosen by -d parameter



WINDOWS USERS
It is a must to have installed cygwin. Under cygwin it is possible to run any 
ART binary program. Or at least, it is necessary to have cygwin1.dll library
copied into c:\windows



CSV input
Input file for every ART program must be in clean csv format. 
All the lines must have the same number of columns. Empty lines
are ignored. In csv files can be added a commentary - all lines 
with FIRST character '#' are considered as a comment. But it has 
to be the FIRST character otherwise it will couse problems!!!

Precision
Input examples are represented as a double (C++ type). 



INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE

Required software:
1. A C++ compiler with standard STL library.
(probably the best possibility is gnu gcc 4.1.2 or newer)

2. A mathematical library gnu gsl (it is needed only by art_distance)

Both packages are freely downloadable.
If you would like to make yourself sure that the GSL library is installed correctly:
   1. download http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xhudik/art/gsl_test.cpp 
   2. run command: g++ gsl_test.cpp -o gsl_test -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
   3. run ./gsl_test -- if result is: "J0(5) = -0.177597" -- required software
   is installed correctly
   Hint: maybe you will have to add path to the gsl library and to it's source codes. 
   In this case the compilation command would look like: 
   g++ gsl_test.cpp -o gsl_test -l/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include lgsla -lgslcblas -lm
   (just change the paths according your own environment). 
   If it is working add the same paths to the Makefile
 


Install

1. install gsl library
    Under linux execute commands:
	yum install gsl
	yum install gsl-devel
    NOTE: if you install it as a normal user (not root)
    you will have to set the correct library linking.
2. Unpack ART tar.bz2 archive in some directory.
   Go into the directory and in command line type a command: make  
   NOTE: If during compiling there is a similar error like:
   art_distance_alg.cpp:6:28: error: gsl/gsl_linalg.h: No such file or directory
   It means that your gsl (or gsl-source) is not correctly installed, or linked.

It is standard make project. Maybe you will have to change some settings in 
Makefile
